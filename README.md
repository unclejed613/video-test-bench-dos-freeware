final freeware version of video test bench

VIDEO TEST BENCH 4.5F FREEWARE
this was a DOS program i wrote back in the 1990's to test CRT monitors.
there are test patterns for everything from IBM monochrome
to SVGA 1024x768.  there are also test loops for "burn-in" testing.
the original hardware requirements to use this software as a "universal"
monitor pattern generator was a trident or oak card with the mode setting 
DIP switches to set the card to MONO, CGA, EGA, VGA or SVGA.
the software autodetects the switch setting, and starts up in the appropriate menu.
i released this freeware version in 2011, which is the complete software
with over 100 test patterns. when i released it, i didn't think to release
the source code, but i am including it here.  to build from source
code requires QuickBasic 4.5 and a shareware library called QLIB58.
