'there were several naming conventions i used while writing the subroutines
'in this program some began with V, X8, or X10 which denote VGA, 800x600
'or 1024x768. these were routines i wrote later. routines with XH in the name
'are crosshatch patterns, CB for color bars, FOC for focus, PUR for purity,
'and several others. routine names ending with CGA, EGA, or with MONO or HERC
'in the name are for the various TTL modes. since this program was written
'over the span of several years, the routine naming conventions varied a
'bit, so may not seem consistent at times. this program began as a series
'of separate BASIC programs to test various functions in monitors. eventually
'i began changing the separate programs into subroutines called by a menu.
' the spaghetti code got quite long and confusing, so i began cutting and
'pasting subroutines into a set of external modules and compiling them
'into a library. i told a service manual supplier what i was doing after
'they asked me if i wanted to buy a $3000.00 test pattern generator.
'it was about this time Trident released their multifunction VGA card
'that also had mono,CGA and EGA outputs, and was configurable by a DIP
'switch. the service manual supplier asked me if i had considered selling
'my software package, and if i could send them a demo. i compiled all of
'the code into a single executable, and made a demo copy which only allowed
'a selected test pattern on the screen for about 20 seconds and sent it to them.
'they began buying copies of VTB and packaging it with Trident cards. then
'another company got wind of it, and wanted to sell the software and card
' as part of an integrated package along with their parts search, service
'database, and service manual lookup software. within a few years we had
'all made some money from the idea, but suddenly the cost of new VGA and
'SVGA monitors dropped from an average of $300-500 to $100-150. this
'happened within the space of two or three months, and the bottom fell out
'of the monitor repair business. i had to find something else to do other
'than repairing monitors and developing test pattern software. fast forward
'to 2010 and questions asked in internet forums about how to repair
'CRT monitors and if there were any way of generating test patterns.
'i decided to release VTB as freeware. fortunately i still have all of
'the code and copies of the Qbasic 4.5 i compiled it with.

'so enough about the history of VTB... let's get coding...
'my notes are sparse, as i didn't keep notes when i wrote VTB but relied on
'the subroutine names to keep straight what they did, and i am only
'now adding the notes.
